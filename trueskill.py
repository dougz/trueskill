  Sets three global parameters used in the TrueSkill algorithm.

  beta is a measure of how random the game is.  You can think of it as
  the difference in skill (mean) needed for the better player to have
  an ~80% chance of winning.  A high value means the game is more
  random (I need to be *much* better than you to consistently overcome
  the randomness of the game and beat you 80% of the time); a low
  value is less random (a slight edge in skill is enough to win
  consistently).  The default value of beta is half of INITIAL_SIGMA
  (the value suggested by the Herbrich et al. paper).

  epsilon is a measure of how common draws are.  Instead of specifying
  epsilon directly you can pass draw_probability instead (a number
  from 0 to 1, saying what fraction of games end in draws), and
  epsilon will be determined from that.  The default epsilon
  corresponds to a draw probability of 0.1 (10%).  (You should pass a
  value for either epsilon or draw_probability, not both.)

  gamma is a small amount by which a player's uncertainty (sigma) is
  increased prior to the start of each game.  This allows us to
  account for skills that vary over time; the effect of old games
  on the estimate will slowly disappear unless reinforced by evidence
  from new games.
